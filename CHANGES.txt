Changes
=======

0.3 
~~~

Apply Chris Lambacher's first set of patches:
- ISAPISImpleHandler creates handler object per request.
- ISAPIThreadPoolHandler where the wsgi requests are run on worker threads from the thread pool.
- App now serves from VirtualDirectory root by default. 

Improved virtual directory support:
- Application can now be deployed to any level of the IIS directory structure including the root.
- SCRIPT_NAME is now set properly (to the app root if it's a *-mapped script handler)

Added Python 3.0 compatibility

First release to PyPI

0.2 First beta release 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added qwip_test.py as an example for running quixote apps via QWIP.

Update README.txt to reflect new example.

Added basic error handling to cope with Extension Errors that are generated
when a client disconnects before the extension i/o has finished. 

Reset self.headers and self.headers_sent in HttpExtensionProc so wsgi states are
correct if Extension Error occurred in previous call.

0.1 
~~~

Change write method so it uses ecb.WriteClient rather than print redirection
which was causing an Extension Error when running QWIP apps.
