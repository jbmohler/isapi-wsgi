Changes
=======

0.4.1
~~~~~

Make manipulation of ECB server variable APPL_MD_PATH case insensitive as string case appears to 
be IIS version/installation dependent.

Add serving from IIS root example - examples\demo_serve_from_root.py

0.4
~~~

Improved virtual directory support:

Application can now be deployed to any level of the IIS directory structure including the root.
 
SCRIPT_NAME is now set properly (to the app root if it's a `*`-mapped script handler)

Added Python 3.0 compatibility

First release to PyPI

Set IIS REMOTE_ADDR env variable as part of WSGI environment.

Add optional size argument to wsgi.input's readline(). This is not part of WSGI spec, but stdlib
cgi.py now requires it.

0.3 
~~~

Apply Chris Lambacher's first set of patches:

ISAPISimpleHandler creates handler object per request.
 
ISAPIThreadPoolHandler where the wsgi requests are run on worker threads from the thread pool.
 
App now serves from VirtualDirectory root by default. 

0.2 First beta release 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added qwip_test.py as an example for running quixote apps via QWIP.

Update README.txt to reflect new example.

Added basic error handling to cope with Extension Errors that are generated
when a client disconnects before the extension i/o has finished. 

Reset self.headers and self.headers_sent in HttpExtensionProc so wsgi states are
correct if Extension Error occurred in previous call.

0.1 
~~~

Change write method so it uses ecb.WriteClient rather than print redirection
which was causing an Extension Error when running QWIP apps.
