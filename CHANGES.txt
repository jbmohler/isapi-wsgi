0.8-0.9 Added qwip_test.py as an example for running quixote apps via QWIP.
Update README.txt to reflect new example.
0.7 Added basic error handling to cope with Extension Errors that are generated
when a client disconnects before the extension i/o has finished. 
Reset self.headers and self.headers_sent in HttpExtensionProc so wsgi states are
correct if Extension Error occurred in previous call.

0.6 Change write method so it uses ecb.WriteClient rather than print redirection
which was causing an Extension Error when running QWIP apps.

0.4 First beta release
